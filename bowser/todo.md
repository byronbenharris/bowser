# State of the World

## What works

- Getting HTML body only
- Rendering HTML text in GUI (mouse scrollable)
- Tokenizing HTML (currently not doing anything with tags)

## List of things not yet implemented

- Keyboard up/down scrolling
  - Looks a bit more involved in Druid
- Font (family, style, weight, size)
  - Use `druid::text::FontDescriptor`
